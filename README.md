### For Developers

#### Local Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/onenoly1010/Ai-forge-.git

# Navigate to directory
cd Ai-forge-

# Install dependencies (optional - for local server)
npm install

# Run local development server
npm start

# Or simply open index.html in your browser
open index.html  # macOS
start index.html # Windows
